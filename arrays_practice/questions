Basic Array Operations
1.Create an Array
Write a program to create an array of integers from 1 to 10 and print it.
2.Access ElementsGiven the array [5, 10, 15, 20, 25], write a program to:
Print the first element.
Print the last element.Print the third element.
3.Array Traversal
Write a program to traverse and print each element of an array [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] using a loop.
4.Array ManipulationsInsert an Element
Write a program to insert the number 50 at the third position of the array [10, 20, 30, 40, 60].
5.Delete an ElementWrite a program to remove the number 15 from the array [5, 10, 15, 20, 25].
6.Update an Element
Replace the value at index 2 with 100 in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
7.Array CalculationsSum of Elements
Write a program to calculate the sum of all elements in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
8.Largest and Smallest ElementWrite a program to find the largest and smallest numbers in the array [3, 6, 1, 8, 2, 9].
9.Average of Elements
Write a program to calculate the average of the numbers in the array [4, 8, 12, 16, 20].
10.Advanced Array ProblemsReverse an Array
Write a program to reverse the array [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].
11.Count OccurrencesWrite a program to count the number of occurrences of the element 3 in the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 5, 6, 3].
12.Even and Odd Separation
Write a program to separate even and odd numbers from the array [10, 15, 20, 25, 30].
13.Second Largest ElementWrite a program to find the second largest number in the array [10, 20, 4, 45, 99].
14.Sort an Array
Write a program to sort the array [6, 3, 8, 5, 2, 7, 4, 1] in ascending order.
15.ChallengesRotate an Array
Write a program to rotate the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] by two positions to the right. The result should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].
16.Find Missing NumberAn array contains integers from 1 to 10, except one number is missing. Write a program to find the missing number from [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
17.Merge Two Arrays
Write a program to merge two sorted arrays [1, 3, 5, 7] and [2, 4, 6, 8] into one sorted array.
18.Check for DuplicatesWrite a program to check if the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3] contains any duplicate elements.
19.Find Intersection
Write a program to find the intersection of two arrays [1, 2, 3, 4] and [3, 4, 5, 6].
20.Pair Sum ProblemWrite a program to find all pairs of numbers in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] that add up to a given sum, say 5
